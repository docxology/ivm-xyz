# IVM-XYZ Package Development Rules

## Code Style and Standards

- Use Python 3.8+ syntax and features
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write comprehensive docstrings for all classes and functions
- Use descriptive variable and function names

## Testing

- All code must have corresponding tests
- Use test-driven development (TDD) approach
- Use real data analysis - no mock methods
- Tests should be in the `tests/` directory
- Run tests with: `python -m pytest tests/` or `python -m unittest discover tests`

## Module Organization

- Core geometric calculations: `ivm_xyz/core/`
- Coordinate conversion: `ivm_xyz/conversion/`
- Polyhedra definitions: `ivm_xyz/polyhedra/`
- Visualization: `ivm_xyz/visualization/`

## Documentation

- Documentation should be "show not tell" - demonstrate usage through examples
- Keep documentation understated and informative
- Update API.md when adding new public functions or methods
- Include mathematical background in docstrings where relevant
- Document all method signatures, parameters, return types, and exceptions
- Include technical implementation details for complex algorithms
- Provide examples for all public methods and classes
- Document edge cases and special behaviors
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes

## Code Quality

- Modular, well-documented, clearly reasoned code
- Avoid redundant code sections
- Scan the repository entirely before making changes
- Use professional, functional, intelligent, wise, modular, concise, elegant, thoughtful code
- Clearly comment code for interpretability

## Mathematical Accuracy

- All geometric calculations must maintain high precision
- Use constants from `ivm_xyz.core.constants` for mathematical constants
- Verify calculations against known geometric properties
- Document any approximations or assumptions

## Import Guidelines

- Use absolute imports from package root
- Keep imports organized and minimal
- Avoid circular dependencies

## Git Workflow

- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes
- Review changes before committing
